#brilo-task

This is my attempt at ruby on rails

I'm just still learning how to use Ruby, so I made a simplified version, here: https://github.com/xJANKOSLAVx/brilo-task-basic

The graphic assignment was here:

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version 2.7.0

* Rails 5.2.3

* sqlite3

I tried to use BEM as a class naming convention. And divide the individual components as much as possible.
